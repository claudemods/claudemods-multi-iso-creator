cmi v2.0 c++ script known issues and info
arch side all updated and working now for ubuntu and debian

changelog cmi advanced c++ script beta v2.0 26-06-2025
my old scripts all work so why dont the new updates?
this is because i planned to open source it and add features i didnt have in the other
i also wanted to try new languages and just have fun you can use the old scripts for now
or wait for a release to say everything works
for now the arch side is fully working for those who want to use the script on arch
my new update later or 27th hopefully, will be based on the ubuntu side of the script 
i will attempt todo debian after but they are similar so i will be working on debian things also
